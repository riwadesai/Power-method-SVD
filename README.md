# Power-method-SVD
Implement SVD computation through power method algorithm for a general ‘large’ An×d matrix. Simulate a large (rectangular) An×d matrix. Compute AtA and apply power method to it.
Your program should have the option for entering choices of parameters k (number of singular vectors to be estimated), ε (threshold for convergence),
α (threshold in terms of proportion of approximation). If not specified then mention some default values. At the end, your program should
report the corresponding singular values and right singular vectors.
